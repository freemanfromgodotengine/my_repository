Notes.

soundtrack   - music is prepared to be looped indefinitely. Loop should sound perfectly smooth. There should be no pauses or anything that would indicate that the music repeats itself.

pin_sounds   - sounds fx designed to always sound proper with the soundtrack music and to add value to the musical style. Pin_sounds should be played with little lower volume (-3 or -6dB ) that should be set properly in the engine.
pin_sound files are numbered from 1 to 8. The idea is to have an eight or less rows of the pins and each row playing different pin_sound when triggered. The falling ball will create a descending melody on itself, that should play nicely together with the music.
